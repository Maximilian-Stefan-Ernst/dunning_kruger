\subsection{Linear Model}
Using a linear regression model, the Dunning-Kruger effect can be stated as
\begin{equation}
 oc^* = \alpha + \beta_1 s^* + u
\end{equation}
with $\beta_1 < 0$.
Substituting the observable variables and rearranging according to eq. \ref{p} and \ref{dd}:
\begin{equation}
  oe = \alpha + \beta_1 p + u - \epsilon(1 + \beta_1)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Correction}
There are different ways to correct for the bias introduced by measurement error:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Bias correction: use a bias correction formula that takes into account the correlation between performance and the error term
 \item IV approach: measure performance on a second test ($p_2$) and compute $\beta_1 = \frac{\cov(oe, p_2)}{\cov(p, p_2)}$.
\end{itemize}
